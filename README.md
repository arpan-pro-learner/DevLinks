# Link Sharing App - Devlinks

This project is a simple link-sharing application built with Next.js. Users can create, edit, delete, and preview links with drag-and-drop functionality. The app has a fully responsive design and can be viewed across different screen sizes.

## Components Overview

### 1. **Footer.jsx**
   - Contains a `Save` button that allows users to save their changes. The placement and inclusion of this button was an assumption based on the functionality of the app.
   
### 2. **Header.jsx**
   - Displays the main header of the application. It may include navigation or a title based on the design of the app.
   
### 3. **LinkEditor.jsx**
   - This component allows users to input or edit links. It contains fields for link URL and title, with validation to ensure the URL pattern is correct.
   
### 4. **LinkItem.jsx**
   - Represents individual link items in the list. It contains logic for displaying the links, their titles, and potentially a preview.
   
### 5. **MobilePreview.jsx**
   - Provides a preview of how the links will appear on a mobile device. This helps ensure the user experience is optimized for smaller screens.
   
### 6. **ProfileDetails.jsx**
   - Displays the user‚Äôs profile details. It could include fields like profile picture, username, and bio.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

- **Save Button**: The decision to add a `Save` button in the `Footer.jsx` was made based on the need for users to save their changes easily.
- **Preview Button**: Similarly, the addition of a preview functionality was based on the assumption that users would want to see how their links appear before finalizing them.
